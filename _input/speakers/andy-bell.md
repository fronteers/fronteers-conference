The market share of mobile devices and small screens is huge and ever-growing while large screen’s share continues to decline. Even with this data, productions teams still work desktop-down, often only testing on high spec machines with fast internet connections.

In this session, we’re going to look at how important products let users with small screens and slow connections down and how a thorough pre-production phase — using an iterative approach — can result in a simpler production phase, a solid roadmap and most importantly, a resilient, quality user experience for everyone.
