talktitle: "Beyond User-Centricity - Designing sustainable digital Products"
---

"Does what we create justify what we destroy?" Tony Fry once said. As designers and creators of digital products and services, we often take pride in crafting beautiful, seamless, and convenient experiences. Yet, behind these creations lies a hidden cost: carbon emissions, water consumption or harmful societal impacts - to name just a few.

In our pursuit of user convenience and excellence, we too often overlook the broader consequences—on both ecological and social systems. This imbalance reveals a critical flaw in our approach: placing the user at the center of everything we do, without considering the surrounding eco-systems.

In this talk, I’ll explore how we can shift our mindset and design sustainable digital products and services by default. You’ll see that integrating sustainability into design isn’t just necessary—but also much easier achievable than you might think.
