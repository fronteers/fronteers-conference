[Brecht de Ruyte](https://utilitybend.com/) Brecht De Ruyte is a self-taught front-end developer located in Belgium with a passion for UX and Design. After more than a decade of working in tech, he started writing down his findings about HTML, CSS, and JS with an eye on accessibility and UX. During the day, you can find him working at iO Ghent on various projects. There are a lot of environments he is working in, the majority of them being Twig and React. But Brecht’s real niche will always be semantics and CSS, especially now, with the ever-fast updates in browser support.
