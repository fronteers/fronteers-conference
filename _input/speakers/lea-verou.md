You may have heard that native CSS Nesting is shipping at a browser near you. You may even have heard that the syntax has changed a fair bit over time, even if you’re fuzzy on the details. This talk will take you backstage and show you how the sausage is made: the trials and tribulations of designing a syntax that balances developer experience, with performance and implementability. Yes, you will learn CSS Nesting in great depth, but this is a talk as much about CSS as it is about the human dynamics of developing languages, products, and APIs that involve cross-functional teams from different organizations, and the many trade-offs and decisions that have to be made before shipping features to the millions of developers worldwide.
