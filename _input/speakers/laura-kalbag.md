Laura Kalbag is a British designer living in Ireland, and author of Accessibility For Everyone from A Book Apart. She’s one third of Indie, a tiny two-person-and-one-husky not-for-profit working for social justice in the digital age. At Ind.ie, Laura follows the Ethical Design Manifesto, works on the Indienet Initiative and a web privacy tool called Better Blocker. On an average day, Laura does everything from design and development, learning how to run a sustainable not-for-profit, and trying to make privacy, and broader ethics in technology, accessible to a wide audience. You can find her making design decisions, writing CSS, nudging icon pixels, or distilling a privacy policy into something humans can understand. Sometimes, she speaks at conferences and writes articles too.
