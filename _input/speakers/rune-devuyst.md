talktitle: "The Dark Side of Bright Colours: The Impact of Your Colour Choices"
---

Every day, billions of people unlock their phones, scroll through websites, check emails, watch videos — and every single pixel that lights up on those screens consumes energy.

We notice slow websites or bad contrast, but we don’t really see the drain that colour choices can have on a device’s energy use. With the rise of OLED displays in smartphones and laptops, this choice is starting to make an impact.

In this talk, we’ll dive deeper into the working of OLED and explore how the colours we choose affect more than just style. You’ll see why some colours require more energy than others, how this relates to accessibility and brand identity, and what practical steps designers and developers can take to create palettes that are both visually appealing and energy-efficient.
