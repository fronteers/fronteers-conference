Henri Helvetica is a freelance developer who has turned his interests to a passionate mix of site performance engineering and user experience. When not reading a deluge of daily research docs and case studies, or auditing sites in dev tools, Henri may be found contributing back to the community: Toronto Web Performance Group meetup, Jamstack Toronto organizer, curating conference content, or volunteering his time for lunch and learns at various bootcamps.

Additionally, you can find Henri frequenting conferences and touching base with the community—all with a radiant smile. In his free time, Henri is focusing on running the fastest (surprise, surprise) 5K possible.
