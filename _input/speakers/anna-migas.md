Web performance has been one of the most talked about web development topics in the recent years. Yet if you try to start your journey with the speed optimisations, you might find yourself in a pickle. With the tooling, you might feel overwhelmed—it looks complex and hard to comprehend. With the metrics: at first glance all of them seem similar, not to mention that they change over time and you cannot figure out which of them to take into account.

In this talk I will lead you through the most popular web performance tooling and the metrics. There will be no more secrets around the topic and you will be able to dive into the web speed optimisations and solution research with confidence.
