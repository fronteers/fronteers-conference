[Bramus](https://www.bram.us/) is a web developer from Belgium. He’s part of the **Chrome Developer Relations** team at Google, focusing on CSS, Web UI, and DevTools. From the moment he discovered `view-source` at the age of 14 _(way back in 1997)_, he**fell in love with the web** and has been tinkering with it ever since.

Before joining Google, Bramus worked as a freelance developer in various frontend and backend roles. For seven years he also was a College Lecturer **Web & Mobile**, educating undergrad students all about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript —[in that order](https://www.bram.us/2023/12/12/embrace-the-platform-article/).
