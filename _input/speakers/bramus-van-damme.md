Bramus Van Damme is a web developer from Belgium. From the moment he discovered view-source at the age of 14 (way back
in 1997), he fell in love with the web and has been tinkering with it ever since.

As a Chrome Developer Relations Engineer at Google, he spreads the word on CSS, UI, and DevTools. Before joining Google,
Bramus worked as a freelance developer in various front- and backend roles. For seven years he also was a College
Lecturer Web & Mobile, educating undergrad students all about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — in that order.
