This year, we’ll gather in the heart of Dordrecht at the charming [Cinema De Witt](https://www.dewittdordrecht.nl/) ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MpZNBQPhSAJrSox46) / [Brochure](https://www.dewittdordrecht.nl/site/assets/files/1150/de_witt_brochure_aug_25.pdf) / [Look Book](https://www.dewittdordrecht.nl/site/assets/files/1150/de_witt_lookbook_augustus_2025.pdf)) – a cultural venue with a long history and an intimate, welcoming atmosphere.

The venue is located just a short walk from Dordrecht Central Station, which offers direct train connections to Rotterdam, Breda, The Hague, and Utrecht. If you're coming from other parts of the country, a transfer in Rotterdam Centraal usually gets you there quickly and comfortably.

Arriving by car? Check out the nearby garage [**Drievriendenhof**](https://share.google/F6KEwlW9HPFRPPhOv) — just a few minutes away and open 24/7.

Whether you arrive by train, bike, or car – getting to Cinema De Witt is easy. We look forward to welcoming you in this inspiring venue!
