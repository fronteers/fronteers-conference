**Pathé Utrecht Leidsche Rijn  
Berlijnplein 100  
3541 CM Utrecht**

The theatre is close to the train station Utrecht Leidsche Rijn with direct connections to Utrecht Central Station, Den Haag and Rotterdam. If you are travelling from other locations, it is recommended to change trains in Utrecht Centraal which is just 1 stop away and only a 4 minute train ride.

If you want to travel by car, there are parking spaces around the theatre and several large parking garages close by.
