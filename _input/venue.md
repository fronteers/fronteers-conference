This year, we’ll gather in the heart of Dordrecht at the charming Cinema De Witt – a cultural venue with a long history and an intimate, welcoming atmosphere.

**Cinema De Witt  
Nieuwstraat 60  
3311 XR Dordrecht**

The venue is located just a short walk from Dordrecht Central Station, which offers direct train connections to Rotterdam, Breda, The Hague, and Utrecht. If you're coming from other parts of the country, a transfer in Rotterdam Centraal usually gets you there quickly and comfortably.

Arriving by car? There are multiple parking garages nearby, including Spuihaven and Drievriendenhof, both within walking distance of the cinema.

Whether you arrive by train, bike, or car – getting to Cinema De Witt is easy. We look forward to welcoming you in this inspiring venue!
