This year we're back at **2 days**, tightly packed with super interesting talks! And as usual, we're not covering just one area of the web, but we want our speakers to provide us with the big picture. We can say that we are very pleased with **this year's line-up**, which reflects that very well.

These are the topics our wonderful MC [Henri Helvetica](/speakers/henri-helvetica/) will lead you through over the course of those two days:

*   W3C and CSS Working Group veteran **[Chris Lilley](/speakers/chris-lilley/)** will present us with a plethora of new CSS color gamuts, spaces and color functions, allowing us for the first time to tap into more vibrant, high dynamic colors  - and you'll learn about their intricacies and implementation shortcomings.
*   We are more than stoked at the fact that YouTube "giant" **[Kevin Powell](/speakers/kevin-powell/)** chose us to be the first conference to ever present at! He will lay out his idea on a modern and more robust approach for authoring CSS.
*   **[Andy Bell](/speakers/andy-bell/)**, usually deep into CSS himself, is going to look at planning and agile methods which lead to the best possible user experience for everyone and especially mobile users.
*   **[Lea Verou](/speakers/lea-verou)** is gonna talk as much about CSS as about the human dynamics of developing languages, products, and APIs. The path to developing the brand new CSS Nesting spec will work as her example.
*   **[Stephanie Nemeth](/speakers/stephanie-nemeth/)** is into beautiful clothing and things that draw power and are JavaScript controlled. Reserve a little budget for the Alibaba electronic parts order you'll likely place right after her talk :D
*   Then we have **[Vasilis van Gemert](/speakers/vasilis-van-gemert/)**. In the name of science, he turns best practices upside down and explores areas no one had thought of before.
*   Have you ever heard of Agent Records, Exec Env, and the like? No? Us neither! These are low-level things at work when our JavaScript engines interpret our code and there's no one better than **[Lydia Hallie](/speakers/lydia-hallie/)** to break them down.
*   **[Erik Kroes](/speakers/erik-kroes/)** is long time accessibility advocate and will shed light on the current state of affairs in that area
*   The first rule of ARIA use is "If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require [...], then do so." **[Hidde de Vries](/speakers/hidde-de-vries/)** will explore in which situations ARIA markup _can_ improve accessibility.
*   In the past few years **[Laura Kalbag](/speakers/laura-kalbag/)** has shifted her focus from general UX and also accessibility to user privacy - and that is also gonna be the topic of her talk with us. Expect a few of your habits and approaches to be heavily challenged!
*   If you are among those struggling to wrap your head around a myriad of performance metrics and especially Google's Web Vital scores, then **[Anna Migas](/speakers/anna-migas/)**'s talk is made for you! She will demystify web performance tooling as well as those metrics for you.
*   **[Sara Vieira](/speakers/sara-vieira/)** says of herself that she creates a lot of random projects because she thinks the web needs some dumb shit. We find her projects not to be dumb at all but rather fascinating! So we asked her if she'd show us how to bring 3D to the web.
*   **[Justin Fagnani](/speakers/justin-fagnani/)**, engineer at Google and creator of Lit will walk you through a Web Component'ized world
*   And finally we have **[Zach Leatherman](/speakers/zach-leatherman/)**, creator of Eleventy and WebC, who will present us his vision of how things should be built for the web (where we may hear the term "Web Components" again).
