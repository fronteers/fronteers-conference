### Please, behave like a decent human being

Fronteers Dark Mode does not tolerate harassment of any sort at any of our locations. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, (physical) following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome (sexual) attention.

Please contact the Fronteers Dark Mode staff if you feel you are being harassed, if you see someone being harassed, or if you have any related concerns:

* Find a crew member IRL (identified by a branded t-shirt and crew badge)
* Reach out to us on Social Media 
* Email us at [confere&#110;ce&#64;fro&#110;&#116;e&#101;rs&#46;nl](m&#97;&#105;lto&#58;&#99;on%66eren&#99;&#101;&#64;%6&#54;%72on%&#55;4%65e%&#55;2s%2&#69;n%&#54;&#67;)

The Fronteers community has proven year after year to be a very welcoming and open group. By joining that group, you will be held to that same high standard.

The Fronteers Dark Mode organisers reserve the right to enforce adherence to the Code of Conduct, by measures up to and including expulsion from our events.
