### Please, behave like a decent human being

Fronteers Conference does not tolerate harassment of any sort at any of our locations. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, (physical) following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome (sexual) attention.

Please contact the Fronteers Conference staff if you feel you are being harassed, if you see someone being harassed, or if you have any related concerns:

* Find a crew member IRL (identified by a branded t-shirt and crew badge)
* Reach out to us on Twitter via [@fronteersconf](https://twitter.com/fronteersconf)
