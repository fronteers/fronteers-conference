## No fronteers conference this year
With a very heavy heart we have to inform you that we aren't able to hold our 14th conference.

Despite a big marketing push in the last few weeks, we didn't manage to sell enough tickets to make it possible for us to
hold this year's conference. The financial risk would have been too big.

We're still trying to figure out what went wrong and what we could have done better.

For everyone who **did** buy a ticket: thank you so much for your support! We are very sorry that we can't keep our side of
the deal. You will be reimbursed as soon as possible.

What this means for the future of the Fronteers Conference we don't know. If something changes we will definitely let you know. 

Your conference committee:
* Jad Joubran
* Jewwy Qadri
* Thijs Reijgersberg
* Niels Leenheer
* Christian Schaefer
