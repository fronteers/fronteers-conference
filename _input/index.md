Fronteers Conference is one of Europe’s premiere conferences on front-end web development and used to be organised in Amsterdam yearly since 2008. That is until 2020 happened. 

This year marks its reboot, albeit with a little different concept: this year will be shorter and smaller, and we will gather at another venue.
