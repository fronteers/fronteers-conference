                        <h3>The CSS Cascade, a deep dive</h3>
                        <p>
                            CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. But what
                            exactly is this Cascade, and how does it work? What
                            are Origins? What happens when we use an !important
                            somewhere? How do you calculate Specificity? And oh,
                            where do those new Cascade Layers you might have
                            heard of fit in?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this insightful talk, we’ll take a look under the
                            hood of browsers, and detail how they determine
                            which CSS declarations to apply and which not.

                        <p>
                            Bramus Van Damme is a web developer from Belgium.
                            From the moment he discovered view-source at the age
                            of 14 (way back in 1997), he fell in love with the
                            web and has been tinkering with it ever since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a Chrome Developer Relations Engineer at Google,
                            he spreads the word on CSS, UI, and DevTools. Before
                            joining Google, Bramus worked as a freelance
                            developer in various front- and backend roles. For
                            seven years he also was a College Lecturer Web &
                            Mobile, educating undergrad students all about HTML,
                            CSS, and JavaScript — in that order.

                        <h3>10 Things You Didn't Know About HTTP/3</h3>
                        <p>
                            By now you've probably heard about the new HTTP/3
                            and QUIC protocols and how they are supposed to make
                            your sites faster and more secure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, you probably don't know yet how some of
                            these advanced features like 0-RTT data, connection
                            migration and head-of-line-blocking removal actually
                            work in practice. Nor why Google Chrome splits the
                            QUIC handshake in dozens of small pieces, which it
                            then re-orders randomly for transmission.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So if you're interested in the lower level details
                            of these new protocols, or just want to know why
                            you'll probably have to configure the new "HTTPS"
                            record in your DNS soon, come to this talk and find
                            out!

                        <p>
                            Robin Marx is a web performance researcher at KU
                            Leuven, Belgium. He’s the author of various papers
                            on HTTP/2, HTTP/3 and QUIC and has been a
                            contributor in the IETF QUIC working group for
                            multiple years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He focuses on creating tools for the QUIC and HTTP/3
                            protocols that help others debug their behavior and
                            performance. He often talks about web performance at
                            international conferences, making the complex
                            situations more insightful to the wider public. On
                            the weekends, he likes to hit other people with
                            longswords.
