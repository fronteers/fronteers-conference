                            CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. But what exactly is this Cascade, and how does it work? What are Origins? What happens when we use an !important somewhere? How do you calculate Specificity? And oh, where do those new Cascade Layers you might have heard of fit in?

                        <p>
                            In this insightful talk, we’ll take a look under the hood of browsers, and detail how they determine which CSS declarations to apply and which not.

                            Bramus Van Damme is a web developer from Belgium. From the moment he discovered view-source at the age of 14 (way back in 1997), he fell in love with the web and has been tinkering with it ever since.

                            As a Chrome Developer Relations Engineer at Google, he spreads the word on CSS, UI, and DevTools. Before joining Google, Bramus worked as a freelance developer in various front- and backend roles. For seven years he also was a College Lecturer Web & Mobile, educating undergrad students all about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — in that order.
