          <p>
            Fronteers Conference is one of Europe’s premiere conferences on front-end web development and used to be organised in
            Amsterdam yearly since 2008. That is until 2020 happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year marks its reboot, albeit with a little different concept: this year will be shorter and smaller, and we will
            gather at another venue.

          <h3>Corona</h3>
          <p>
            Fronteers Conference will be held in an indoor theatre and will honor local legal requirements regarding registration,
            social distancing, masking, testing and number of attendees. Weather permitting, the afterparty will be held in the
            outdoors on the rooftop of the theatre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now there are no legal restrictions, but that could change. We will update you on the rules once they become
            clear.

          <h3>Code of conduct</h3>
          <p>
            To Fronteers Conference, and to our parent, the Fronteers association, it is of vital importance that everyone at our
            events feels welcome and safe. We are quite proud of the wonderful front-end community in and around the Netherlands,
            and we're actively enforcing a code of conduct to make sure that all attendees, speakers and volunteers know that we're
            there for them if there's anything amiss. By attending our events, you agree to adhere to the Fronteers Conference Code
            of Conduct.
