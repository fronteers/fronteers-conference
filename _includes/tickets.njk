        <h3>Member discount</h3>
        <p>
          Members of the Fronteers association are entitled to a discount. Members who want to purchase a discounted ticket must already be a member when ticket sales are first announced and will receive a voucher code by email. If you order tickets for multiple people at once, you will need to collect voucher codes from those of you who are members and use all their codes in the ordering process.
