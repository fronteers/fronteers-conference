        <h3>CSS in 2022 (and beyond)</h3>
        <p>
          Things have been going hard for CSS the past few years, and there's a bunch of new and exciting stuff on its way.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this talk you'll be up to speed on some very nice recent additions, and will get a glimpse of a lot of the features

        <h4>Bramus Van Damme</h4>
        <img src="{{ '/img/speaker-bramus-van-damme.png' | url }}" alt="">
          <p>
            Bramus Van Damme is a web developer from Belgium. From the moment he discovered view-source at the age of 14 (way back
            in 1997), he fell in love with the web and has been tinkering with it ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Chrome Developer Relations Engineer at Google, he spreads the word on CSS, UI, and DevTools. Before joining Google,
            Bramus worked as a freelance developer in various front- and backend roles. For seven years he also was a College
            Lecturer Web & Mobile, educating undergrad students all about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — in that order.

          <h3>Web Protocols for Frontend Developers</h3>
          <p>
            HTTP/3 is here, and it promises major performance benefits! Most of these we get for free, with just the flip of a
            switch. Some however allow or even require tweaking by (frontend) developers for optimal performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this talk, we'll look at the high-level options you as a developer have to steer HTTP/2 and 3 behaviour, and how
            those actually work internally. We'll consider preloading, lazy loading and priority hints. We take a critical look at
            keeping your core HTML/CSS smaller than 14KB in the 0-RTT era. And we'll also discuss the new hotness of 103 Early
            Hints, aka "Server Push Killer".
          </p>
          <p>
            Combining networking 101, protocol history, and especially practical tips, you'll learn what's happening under the hood
            and how to tune it yourself.

          <h4>Robin Marx</h4>
          <img src="{{ '/img/speaker-robin-marx.png' | url }}" alt="">
            <p>
              Robin Marx is a Web Performance Architect at Akamai. He’s the author of various papers on HTTP/2, HTTP/3 and QUIC and
              has been a contributor in the IETF QUIC working group for multiple years.
            </p>
            <p>
              He focuses on creating tools for the QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols that help others debug their behavior and performance. He
              often talks about web performance at international conferences, making the complex situations more insightful to the
              wider public. On the weekends, he likes to hit other people with longswords.

              Debugging web privacy
            </h3>

              Checkout flows that ask for too much data, cookie notices that hurt site performance, maddening location permission
              requests… Privacy decisions don't only have an impact on user trust: they also determine the user experience! In her
              talk, Maud will walk you through concrete tips and code examples you can use today to improve the privacy of your
              users⏤while delivering a great user experience.

            <h4>Maud Nalpas</h4>

              <p>
                Maud is a developer relations engineer at Chrome for web security and privacy. Before joining Google, Maud was a
                full-stack developer leaning towards frontend development. She knows first-hand that the concepts needed to build
                private and secure websites can feel puzzling and obscure⏤and she's on a mission to change just that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maud lives in Berlin and enjoys windsurfing, baking cookies, and playing the guitar off-key.

                Beyond the persona
              </h3>
              <p>Designers tend to take the average user and design solutions of that average persona by using design and empathy. But
                to design products and services that are truly inclusive we have to go beyond empathy and asking questions.</p>
              <p>In my talk I'll explain why Design Thinking doesn't work and you'll learn how to transform your design process to be
                really inclusive.</p>

                <p>
                  As an user experience designer and teacher, Marie van Driessche (Amsterdam) is fascinated by the way people interact
                  with digital products and each other. Her focus is to design proper, meaningful and inclusive solutions. Currently she
                  works as an user experience designer with a focus on accessibility at Unc Inc. Marie also teaches UX / UI design at
                  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides all the above, she loves to kitesurf, gardening and reading cookbooks in bed before falling asleep.

                  Unlock the Fun!
                </h3>
                <p>Creating outstanding typographic designs is not just about choosing the right font. It’s about using all the super
                  powers that font technology offers you today.</p>
                <p>In her talk, Ulrike will reveal some playful type experiments that show evidence: type is not just for reading but
                  it’s fun and entertaining, too.</p>
                <p>You will learn how to tap the full potential of a font, which will enable you to create stunning designs, leaving
                  your clients with a smile.</p>
                <h4>Ulrike Rausch</h4>

                  <p>
                    In 2009 Berlin-based type designer Ulrike Rausch founded her own type foundry called LiebeFonts, providing high-quality
                    typefaces with a charming personality and obsessive attention to detail. Her growing portfolio of handwriting fonts has
                    been used in publications, advertisements, and websites all around the world. She also creates custom typefaces for
                    clients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Ulrike is not busy with her next font release, she enjoys teaching at art schools and giving type design workshops
                    in her studio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Together with letterer and writer Chris Campe, she wrote the book “Making Fonts!”, a comprehensive guide to type design
                    and font production.

                    Lost in Translation
                  </h3>
                  <p>A frontend developer’s job is to look at a design, interpret it, and translate it to HTML and CSS. Unfortunately,
                    information often gets lost in translation because we rely too much on visual aspects of a design, rather than its
                    semantic meaning.</p>
                  <p>In his talk, Manuel Matuzović uncovers the invisible patterns we should recognise in a design, and how they affect
                    accessibility.</p>
